📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Senior SEO Audit Findings: Top 3 Critical Errors

Based on the raw crawl data, the most immediate and severe issues concern homepage canonicalization and content duplication.
# 	Critical Error 	Severity 	Description
1 	Severe Duplicate Title Tags 	High 	Three distinct URLs (/, /#content, and the root domain) are serving the exact same Title Tag: "Home - Marketing With Shruti". This signals severe content duplication and a failure to consolidate link equity to a single canonical homepage version.
2 	Broken Canonicalization/Redirect Chain 	High 	The existence of three identical versions of the homepage content (URLs 1, 2, and 3) indicates that the necessary 301 redirects and canonical tags are not properly implemented. This forces search engines to crawl and choose a single version, wasting valuable crawl budget.
3 	Fragment URL Indexation 	Medium/High 	The presence of a fragment URL (https://www.marketingwithshruti.com#content) in the crawl data is highly problematic. Search engines typically ignore the fragment, but its inclusion in the index suggests either a fundamental internal linking error or a failure to properly handle anchor links, contributing directly to duplication issues (Error 1).
Summary Action Required

The immediate priority is to implement proper canonical tags on the homepage variants and enforce 301 redirects to ensure all traffic and equity consolidates to the preferred root domain (e.g., https://www.marketingwithshruti.com/).
